# Predicting-Diabetes-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In this project, I implemented k-Nearest Neighbors classifier,logistic regression,LinearSVC,DecisionTreeClassifier,RandomForestClassifier,GradientBoostingClassifier, and MLPClassifier with Python on Kaggle “Diabetes Dataset” dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset or not. First of all, I explored and then visualized data using some plots. After that, the machine learning project starts. Next, 7 mentioned classification models are implemented.
